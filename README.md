## About
Hi, I'm Nathan! I am currently on track to graduate in December 2023 with a degree in Biology, Health, and Society along with a minor in Applied Statistics. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills as well as my experiences gained through leading a biomedical engineering club on campus and conducting research on behavioral economics through the Pharmacology Department at Michigan Medicine.

This is a Repository to share projects I have taken on, showcase skills, and keep track of my learning within Data Science related topics.
